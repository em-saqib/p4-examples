Download csv and pcap from UNSW website: https://iotanalytics.unsw.edu.au/iottraces.html
Add devices names to the data using  script: addDevicesNames.py (data: csv/16-09-23.csv, deviceNames: csv/list_devices.csv)
Filter-out the csv data to drop or select specefic devices uaing script filterDevices.py
Makes the data ready for the model using script modelReadyData.py (save it as csv to import it to p4-VM)
Run Machinelearning.py on the csv data (./Machinelearning -i csv/data.csv -o tree.txt)
Run converter.py to convert the tree.txt into rules for p4 switch (./converter [input:tree.txt and action.txt output:rules.cmd])
Filter-out the pcap data to drop or select specrfic devcices using script filterPcap.py (input: pcap/data.pcap output:pcap/filtered.pcap)
Run simulation using script ./rn.sh and run ./rn2 to intert the rules.cmd to the switch
Send data of filtered pcap file (pcap/filtered.pcap) using send3.py from h1 host to h3 host [h1: ./send3.py 10.0.3.3, h3: ./recieve.py]
Copy switch s1 filtred logs to another file (sudo grep "]  INFO CSV" s1.log > /home/p4/tutorials/exercises/basic20/s1.log)
Run ClassificationResultsFilter.py on filtred logs to extarct number of classiifed flows for each class



Scripts:
To extract unqie flows from pcap: tshark -r test.pcap -q -z conv,tcp > tcp.conv
Split pcaps: tcpdump -r olddata.pcap -w newdata.pcap -C 10
